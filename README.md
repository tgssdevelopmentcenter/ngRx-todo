# NGRX Todos - Development Center

## Using store states, actions, and reducers in NgRx

# Store state

`The store can be seen as your client side database but, more importantly, it reflects the state of your application. You can see it as the single source of truth.`

`It is the only thing you alter when you follow the Redux pattern and you modify by dispatching actions to it `
